 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2]\n[-2,-1]\n[-1,2]\n[0,2]'
 *
 * Given four integer arrays nums1, nums2, nums3, and nums4 all of length n,
 * return the number of tuples (i, j, k, l) such that:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= i, j, k, l < n
 * nums1[i] + nums2[j] + nums3[k] + nums4[l] == 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [-2,-1], nums3 = [-1,2], nums4 = [0,2]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * The two tuples are:
 * 1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> nums1[0] + nums2[0] + nums3[0] + nums4[1] = 1 + (-2) +
 * (-1) + 2 = 0
 * 2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> nums1[1] + nums2[1] + nums3[0] + nums4[0] = 2 + (-1) +
 * (-1) + 0 = 0
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums1 = [0], nums2 = [0], nums3 = [0], nums4 = [0]
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == nums1.length
 * n == nums2.length
 * n == nums3.length
 * n == nums4.length
 * 1 <= n <= 200
 * -2^28 <= nums1[i], nums2[i], nums3[i], nums4[i] <= 2^28
